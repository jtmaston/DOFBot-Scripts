## Motivation
The progress of technology in recent times has facilitated widespread accessibility to various forms of technology.
The field of Robotics is no exception, with an increasing number of kits readily available to interested individuals.
This accessibility enables students to comprehend and study the fundamental aspects of industrial robotics without the
need for exclusive or expensive hardware. A particular kit was employed in this study, which enabled the creation of a
miniature but functionally similar 5 DOF robot arm. The emphasis was on the firmware of the robot, which
is essentially the foundational software that enables the robot to operate.

## Project goals
This project aims to emulate the capabilities of an industrial robot, in a simple to understand educational application.
The prime goal is to have an open implementation of what might be found in an industrial robot, while maintaining an
open architecture so it may be further developed or used in a learning setting.
- **Programmability**: The robot must be able to run a fixed program, by following instructions either programmed
  directly, by jogging, or generated by specialized off-line programming and simulation software.
- **Independent and synchronous axis control**: a closed feedback loop must be created for each motor, with each motor
  being both commanded to a certain position, and that trajectory be monitored constantly, by sampling the built-in 
  rotary encoders.
- **Driving of the HMI**: data must be fed to and received from the HMI, in order for it to function.
- **The calculation of kinematic parameters**: implementation of a direct kinematics model that is able to compute the
direct kinematics of the manipulator, and provide the position and orientation of the end-effector.
